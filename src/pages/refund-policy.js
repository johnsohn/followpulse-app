Payment will be charged to the payment method you provided at the time of purchase. You authorize us to charge the applicable subscription fees to the payment method that you have chosen.</p><h2>IV. CANCELLATION</h2><p>Canceling your subscription means that the automatic renewal will be disabled, but you will still have access to all your subscription features for the remaining time of your then-current period. Note that deleting the app does not cancel your subscriptions.</p><p>If you purchased a subscription or enabled free trial on App Store: If you are eligible for a refund, you’ll have to request it directly from Apple. To request a refund, follow these instructions from the <a href="https://support.apple.com/">Apple support page</a>.</p><p>If you purchased a subscription or enabled free trial on Google Play: If you are eligible for a refund, you'll have to request it directly from Google.

To avoid being charged for your next billing period, cancel your subscription at least 24 hours before your next billing date. Subscription fees are non-refundable.</p><h2>V. REFUNDS</h2><p>Please note that, generally, all purchases are considered final and non-refundable. We do not offer refunds or credits for partially used periods, except as required by applicable laws in your jurisdiction and certain criteria established by our company:</p><p>To qualify for a refund, customers must meet one of the following criteria:</p><ol><li><h3> Refund Requests Within 2 Days: </h3><p>To be eligible for a refund, customers must submit their request within 2 days of making their purchase directly through our website. It is essential that all refund claims are made before the end of the subscription period.</p><p>Eligibility for a refund within this 2-day window will be determined based on product usage. We define active usage as sending more than 10 message requests through our product. Such active usage will make the purchase non-refundable. Conversely, customers who have sent fewer than 10 message requests may qualify for a refund, assuming their request is filed within the 2-day period.</p><p>Given the considerable server resources and associated costs of operating the AI models that facilitate our service, purchases made by users who exceed the defined activity threshold (more than 10 message requests) will not be eligible for refunds.</p></li></ol><h3>Exceptions:</h3><ul class="PrivacyContent_exceptions__IbRtx"><li><p><span>Beyond 2 Days:</span> Any refund requests made more than 2 days after the purchase date are non-refundable.</p></li><li><p><span>Active Usage: </span>Due to the significant server resources and costs associated with running the AI models that power our service, purchases by actively engaged users (as defined above) are non-refundable.</p></li></ul><h3>General Conditions:</h3><p>Payments are non-refundable and/or non-exchangeable if the conditions of this Refund Policy are not met. Additionally, should an alternative refund option (e.g., a free trial) be offered at checkout, it will supersede this Refund Policy, and customers opting for that alternative will not be eligible for refunds hereunder.</p><h2>VI. CHARGEBACKS/DISPUTES</h2><p>If, at any time, you initiate a chargeback or otherwise reverse any payment of applicable subscription fees in your account, we may disable or terminate your account immediately at our sole discretion for the breach of your payment obligations hereunder. We reserve the right to dispute any chargeback received, including by providing the relevant financial institution with any information proving that the payment in question was authorized by the user responsible for such chargeback.</p><h2>VII. CHANGES TO THIS REFUND POLICY</h2><p>We reserve the right to modify, terminate, or otherwise amend our offered subscription plans at any time. We will give you reasonable notice of any such changes by posting them on or through the App and/or by sending you an email notification, or in other prominent ways. If you do not wish to pay the new fees, you can cancel the applicable subscription prior to the change going into effect.</p><p>*Please make a screenshot of this information for your reference.
